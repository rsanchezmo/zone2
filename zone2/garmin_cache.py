"""SQLite-backed cache for Garmin daily wellness payloads + sync orchestration.

The cache stores one row per (date, metric) holding the raw JSON payload from
`garminconnect`, zlib-compressed (a fifth of the size). Charts pluck fields
from the payload at read time — keeping the schema generic means new fields
from Garmin firmware updates appear without migrations.

Why plain `sqlite3` (not aiosqlite)?
- The sync worker runs in a thread pool (FastAPI BackgroundTasks with a sync
  function), where aiosqlite buys nothing.
- All Strava routers in this codebase are sync handlers, so sync DB access
  matches the surrounding style.
- The DB is small and writes are infrequent; a fresh connection per call is
  cheap and avoids any cross-thread connection-sharing footguns.

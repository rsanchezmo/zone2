# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

z2 is a full-stack application for analyzing and visualizing Strava activities locally, without Strava Premium. It syncs activities via the Strava API, caches them as Parquet files, and provides a React web app with dashboards, personal records, training calendar, and map visualizations — plus a Telegram bot and CLI-generated neon-styled PNG reports.

## Setup & Running

```bash
# Install dependencies (Poetry required, Python 3.12+)
poetry install

# Run the web app (backend + frontend dev servers)
python run_dev.py
# Backend: http://localhost:8000 (FastAPI/Uvicorn)
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (Vite dev server, proxies /api to backend)

# Or run individually
cd frontend && npm run dev     # Frontend only
uvicorn backend.app:app --port 8000  # Backend only

# Run the main script (example usage / sandbox)
python main.py

# Run the Telegram bot (requires TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID in .env)
python telegram_bot.py

# Docker deployment (includes Cloudflare Tunnel support)
docker-compose up
```

**Environment variables** (`.env` file in project root):
- `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` / `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` — required for API access
- `STRAVA_WEB_*` — backend config (loaded via Pydantic settings in `backend/config.py`)
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` — optional, for the Telegram bot
- `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN` — optional, for Docker deployment with Cloudflare Tunnel
- `STRAVA_WEB_CARTO_API_KEY` — optional; without it Leaflet basemaps fall back to OSM, since unkeyed CARTO tiles are watermarked

There are no tests or CI configured. The frontend has ESLint (react-hooks v7 / React Compiler rules) — keep `cd frontend && npm run lint` and `npx tsc -b` at zero errors.

## Architecture

### Core Class Hierarchy

`Zone2` (in `zone2/core.py`) is the main orchestrator that wires everything together:

```
Zone2
├── StravaEndpoint          — Strava API client (OAuth, activity/stream fetching)
├── StravaActivitiesCache   — Local Parquet-based activity storage with lazy in-memory loading
├── StravaUserCache          — Cached user profile/zones data
├── StravaAnalytics          — Computes stats (year-in-sport, weekly reports, HR zones, VO2max)
└── StravaVisualizer         — All matplotlib visualizations (heatmaps, dashboards, reports)
```

### Data Flow

1. **Sync**: `StravaEndpoint` fetches activities from Strava API → `StravaActivitiesCache` stores them as monthly Parquet files under `.strava/activities/{year}/{YYYY-MM}.parquet`
2. **Streams**: High-res GPS/HR data is fetched separately per-activity and stored as JSON within the Parquet columns
3. **Analysis**: `StravaAnalytics` reads from the cache and computes aggregated stats (returns plain dicts keyed by `StrEnum` feature classes: `YearInSportFeatures`, `AllYearInSportFeatures`, `WeeklyReportFeatures`)
4. **Visualization**: `StravaVisualizer` takes analytics output and generates PNG files in `{workdir}/` subdirectories
5. **Web API**: FastAPI backend (`backend/`) exposes analytics and cache data as REST endpoints consumed by the React frontend

### Web App (Frontend + Backend)

**Backend** (`backend/`): FastAPI app with 8 API routers at `/api/*`:
- `activities.py` — List, filter, sort activities; polylines for maps; similar activities
- `stats.py` — Weekly reports, year-in-sport, efficiency factor, performance frontier, personal records, streaks
- `calendar.py` — Training session CRUD, scoring
- `exports.py` — PNG image generation (weekly reports, heatmaps, activity plots)
- `sync.py` — Background sync tasks, stream backfill, cache status
- `athlete.py` — Profile, rate limits, HR zones
- `goals.py` — Yearly goal CRUD with progress tracking
- `workouts.py` — Workout template management with segments
- `dependencies.py` — DI providing `Zone2` singleton
- `config.py` — Pydantic settings (`workdir`, `cors_origins`, `sync_max_age_hours`)
- `db.py` — SQLite via aiosqlite at `.strava/calendar.db` (tables: `training_sessions`, `goals`, `workout_templates`)

**Frontend** (`frontend/`): React 19 + TypeScript + Vite SPA:
- **Stack**: TailwindCSS 4, React Router 7, TanStack React Query, Recharts, Leaflet
- **Pages** (8): Dashboard, Activities, ActivityDetail, Calendar, Aggregations, PersonalRecords, Profile, Workouts
- **Layout**: `AppShell` with dock navigation, dark/light theme support
- **API layer**: Axios client at `/api`, 40+ React Query hooks in `api/hooks.ts`
- **Dev**: Vite dev server on :5173 proxies `/api` to backend on :8000

**Deployment**: Multi-stage Dockerfile (Node 22 builds frontend → Python 3.12 serves via Uvicorn); docker-compose with optional Cloudflare Tunnel

### Map Matching (separate entry point)

`StravaMapMatcher` (`zone2/map_matching.py`) matches each activity to one continuous route with the route-based HMM in `zone2/route_matching.py` (Newson & Krumm style: candidates per GPS point, transitions scored by network route vs straight distance, outliers skipped instead of breaking the chain). It routes on a walkable network: streets (`{slug}_edges.parquet`, the credited coverage network) plus connectors such as sidewalks, crossings and steps (`{slug}_connectors.parquet`, never credited), both built straight from Overpass (via OSMnx's client, no OSMnx graph). Streets are credited when the route walks half of them, beside sidewalks the route used, or as parallel ways alongside the GPS track; each activity's route is stored in `{slug}_routes.parquet` and served at `/api/coverage/routes/{activity_id}` for the activity map. Input comes from `get_activities_as_gdf_from_streams()`; `match()` returns a `MatchResult` per activity. Every Strava sync ends with an incremental coverage sync of all cities (`sync_all_cities`); `pending_activities` checks what's new from the small state files, so nothing is loaded when there is nothing to match.

### Key Conventions

- All geo data uses `EPSG:4326` (BASE_CRS) as base, projected to `EPSG:3857` (WEB_MERCATOR_CRS) for visualization
- Speed is stored in m/s (Strava API native); conversion to pace/speed uses `convert_speed()` / `format_pace_or_speed()` in `zone2/utils.py` which auto-detects sport category
- Sport categories are classified via string matching in `zone2/utils.py`: running, cycling, swimming
- Visualizations use a consistent dark/neon aesthetic with configurable `neon_color` parameters
- Output images for reports use Instagram Story aspect ratio (9:16)
- Token/auth data cached in `.strava/token.json`; activity metadata in `.strava/metadata.json`
- `telegram_bot.py` uses `matplotlib.use("Agg")` for headless rendering and runs blocking Strava operations in a thread pool
- Frontend uses dark theme by default with custom surface color tokens and neon accents

### Files of Note

- `run_dev.py` — Runs backend + frontend dev servers concurrently
- `zone2/mcp.py` — Placeholder for future MCP server integration (currently empty)
- `main.py` — Sandbox/example script, not a library entry point
- `cache/` — SHA-based JSON cache files (for user data caching via `StravaUserCache`)
